# sensei-bot
Discord bot for fetching them good ol' wikipedias

# TODO

* [ ] Get wiki extracts command function properly
* [ ] Work out a pretty design for replies, either `preformatted text` with pretty colors, or regular discord markdown or whatever
* [ ] `doi` command for fetching abstracts of scientific articles
  * Probably needs some fleshing out, a search function rather than having to use a doi number would make a lot more sense
